# !! YAML doesnâ€™t allow literal tab characters for indentation !!

# ========== Canonical configuration for the services ==========

# The order of precedence (highest to lowest) is as follows:

# - Set using docker compose run -e in the CLI
# - Substituted from your shell
# - Set using the environment attribute in the Compose file
# - Use of the --env-file argument in the CLI
# - Use of the env_file attribute in the Compose file
# - Set using an .env file placed at base of your project directory
# - Set in a container image in the ENV directive.
# - Having any ARG or ENV setting in a Dockerfile evaluates only if there is no Docker Compose entry for environment, env_file or run --env.
